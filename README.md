Requirement given by **Suzanne** via Mail

Please create a public repository, and write a solution for the following small coding challenge, using clean code principles, and preferable C++, Python, or Javascript as a programming language:

 - Calculate the 15th element for this sequence: 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, ...? - the new element is calculated based on the last two element sum, so the next element will be 10 + 16.

 - Please create a docblock and answer the following questions:
   - What is the 15th element of the sequent?
   - What is your solution time and space complexity, regarding for the n(th) element of the sequent?
   - What clean code principles you have been used, and why?
   - Bonus: can you make your code recursive? If yes, what would be your time and space complexity?

If you are ready with your code, and comments please upload to any online repository (github, gitlab, repl.to, etc) and send only the link to us, not the code.

## Answers

 - The solution has programmed in both Python and Javascript programming in the following file repectively.
 - The 15th element of the sequence is 1220 which is printed in both programs using both loop and recursive program.
